DESCRIPTION:

With the parameters taken as:
bandwidth1(t1)=1 Mbps
bandwidth2(t2)=2 Mbps
distance1(d1)=100 km
distance2(d2)=200 km
packet size (M)=10000 bits
acknowledgement size (A)=1000 bits
speed of communication (S)= 2*10^5 km/s
     We need to find the total end-to-end delay with an acknowledgement for two packets.

                             Transmission delay= data size/bandwidth.
                             
                             Propogation delay= distance/transmission speed. 

PACKET 1:
       The first packet is transmitted from host A to router R which includes transmission and propogation.

transmission delay(tdA):    10000 bits/1 Mbps
                            = 10.0 ms.

propogation delay(pdA):     100 km/(2*10^5 km/s)
                            = 0.5 ms.

      The first packet is then transmitted from router R to host B which includes transmission and propogation.

transmission delay(tdR):    10000 bits/2 Mbps
                            = 5.0 ms.

propogation delay(pdR):     200 km/(2*10^5 km/s)
                            = 1.0 ms.

Therefore, the time taken from host A to host B = 16.5 ms.
Now host B should send an acknowledgement to host A.The second packet cannot be transmitted till the acknowledgement is sent from B.

transmission delay(aB):    1000 bits/2 Mbps
                            = 0.5 ms.

propogation delay(pdR):     200 km/(2*10^5 km/s)
                            = 1.0 ms.

transmission delay(aR):    1000 bits/1 Mbps
                            = 1.0 ms.

propogation delay(pdA):     100 km/(2*10^5 km/s)
                            = 0.5 ms.
 
The time taken for the acknowledgement to reach host A = 19.5 ms
The same process is followed when the second packet is sent.

        Hence,the total end-to-end delay after recieving the second packet's acknowledgement is 39.0 ms.
